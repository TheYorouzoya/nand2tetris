# Hack Assembler

A Java program that consumes hack assembly code and outputs the respective 16-bit text binary code for the CPU emulator.

## Usage

*Requires Java 17 and above.*

Compile the java files first,

```shell
prompt> javac HackAssembler.java
```

Then run,

```shell
prompt> java HackAssembler FILE_NAME.hack
```

where FILE_NAME is a Hack assembly file (.hack). The program will generate a text binary file for the Hack CPU emulator with a .asm extension in the same folder as the input file.

## Documentation

The Hack Assembly language only consists of two kinds of instructions (i.e., there's only 1 bit for the op code): an ***A-instruction*** or a ***C-instruction***. Below are the instruction set mnemonics,

The A-instruction is the only way to input a constant into the computer. The instruction's primary purpose is to point to an address so as to either store the result of a C-instruction in the RAM or to jump to the address location in the instruction memory after executing a C-instruction. The C-instruction, on the other hand, is the most involved and performs all the computation the Hack CPU supports.

Together with these two, the Hack Assembly also supports adding labels in code to jump to, along with single-line comments starting with a "//". Furthermore, there are some special symbols/keywords which are reserved and point to locations in memory (mainly for pointing to memory segments for the VM). Here's one of my drawings which goes over all of this with an example:

The assembler consumes a hack assembly program file and does the following:
- Cleans up all whitespace and comments
- Translates all symbols to the appropriate instruction addresses
- Convert all instructions and symbols to binary
- Output the resulting binary

The assembler performs this by doing two passes over the program code -- one to clean up and tally the symbols in a symbol table; the second one, to generate the required binaries.

There are two main caveats here, though. The first, and probably the most egregious one, is that the assembler assumes that the given program is error-free. This was part of the specification, so no error-checking is performed and no useful feedback is given. If a line doesn't contain valid code, it is completely ignored. Now, for the second one. Because the Hack program for this course was to be run on a CPU emulator, the final output isn't a proper binary file but rather a text file where each line contains an instruction in 0s and 1s (the ASCII binary, as I like to call it). The emulator would consume this file and run the program.
